The Déjà Fu documentation has moved!
====================================

    [Déjà Fu is] A martial art in which the user's limbs move in time
    as well as space, […] It is best described as "the feeling that
    you have been kicked in the head this way before"

    **Terry Pratchett, Thief of Time**
