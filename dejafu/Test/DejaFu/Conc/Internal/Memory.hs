-- Operations over @CRef@s and @MVar@s. This module is NOT considered
-- to form part of the public interface of this library.
--
-- Relaxed memory operations over @CRef@s are implemented with an
-- explicit write buffer: one per thread for TSO, and one per
-- thread/variable combination for PSO. Unsynchronised writes append
-- to this buffer, and periodically separate threads commit from these
-- buffers to the \"actual\" @CRef@.
--
-- This model comes from /Dynamic Partial Order Reduction for Relaxed
-- Memory Models/, N. Zhang, M. Kusano, and C. Wang (2015).
