synopsis:            Overloadable primitives for testable, potentially non-deterministic, concurrency.

description:
  /[Déjà Fu is] A martial art in which the user's limbs move in time as well as space, […] It is best described as "the feeling that you have been kicked in the head this way before"/ -- Terry Pratchett, Thief of Time
  .
  Concurrency is nice, deadlocks and race conditions not so much. The
  @Par@ monad family, as defined in
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/abstract-par/docs/Control-Monad-Par-Class.html abstract-par>
  provides deterministic parallelism, but sometimes we can tolerate a
  bit of nondeterminism.
  .
  This package provides a class of monads for potentially
  nondeterministic concurrency, with an interface in the spirit of
  GHC's normal concurrency abstraction.
  .
  == @MonadConc@ with 'IO':
  .
  The intention of the @MonadConc@ class is to provide concurrency
  where any apparent nondeterminism arises purely from the scheduling
  behaviour. To put it another way, a given computation, parametrised
  with a fixed set of scheduling decisions, is deterministic. This
  assumption is used by the testing functionality provided by
  Test.DejaFu.
  .
  Whilst this assumption may not hold in general when 'IO' is
  involved, you should strive to produce test cases where it does.
  .
  See the <https://github.com/barrucadu/dejafu README> for more
  details.
